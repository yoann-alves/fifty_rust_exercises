# 🦀 Fifty Rust Exercises

A structured journey through Rust fundamentals - from zero to competent.

## 📖 Purpose

50 hands-on exercises designed to build solid Rust foundations through deliberate practice.
Based on "The Rust Programming Language" (The Book) with emphasis on:

- Writing code from scratch (no copy-paste)
- Understanding every line
- Testing rigorously
- Building muscle memory

## 🎯 Rules

1. **TYPE everything** - Never copy-paste, even from your own code
2. **UNDERSTAND every line** - If you don't know why, STOP and research
3. **READ error messages** - The Rust compiler is your best teacher
4. **TEST your code** - Normal case, edge cases, error cases
5. **No external dependencies** - stdlib only (unless explicitly allowed)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Rust installed (`rustup`)

   - See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

2. **Clone this repo**:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoann-alves/fifty_rust_exercises.git
   cd fifty_rust_exercises
```

3. **Start with exercise 1**:

```bash
   cd exercises/01_hello_custom
   cargo run
```

4. **Read the exercise README** before coding
5. **Implement, test, iterate**
6. **Move to next exercise**

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Recommended approach:**

1. Read "The Rust Book" completely (code the examples)
2. Do all 50 exercises (first pass - make it work)
3. Re-read "The Rust Book" (with experience)
4. Redo all 50 exercises (second pass - make it excellent)
